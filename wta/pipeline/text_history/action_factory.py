    Aggregating actions enables identification of transforming sequences in the next pipeline step.
    Aggregation is triggered if the actions are of the same type

    and they are of one of the following types:
    - append (consecutive means startpos, startpos+1, startpos+2, ...)
    - insertion (consecutive means startpos, startpos+1, startpos+2, ...)
    - deletion with backspace (consecutive means startpos, startpos-1, startpos-2, ...)
    - midletion (consecutive means startpos, startpos-1, startpos-2, ...)
    - deletion with del (consecutive means the position does not change and the text len gets shorter)
    Aggregation is not performed for the following action types:
    - replacement
    - pasting
    - navigation
