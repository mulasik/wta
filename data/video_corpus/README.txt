=== Video Corpus ===

The Video Corpus consists of 7 texts written by three female and four male writers aged 34 to 62 all having an academic background.
The texts are short descriptive comments after watching a two-minute Youtube video on how to assemble a DIY macro lens for a smartphone. They wrote for about 10 minutes in German. The writing processes were recorded with ScriptLog (Johansson, Frid, & Wengelin, 2018) and exported in IDFX-format.

and sentence histories from writing process data: a first step towards linguistic modeling of writing. Reading and Writing, 37 , 443–482, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-021-10234-6.
