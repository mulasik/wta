=== THEcorpus ===

Text History Extraction Corpus consists of 14 sets of keystroke logs from writing sessions with 7 young adults writing 2 blog posts each. The writers are students of a bachelor program and write texts in their first language, German. The writing processes were recorded with ScriptLog (Johansson, Frid, & Wengelin, 2018) and exported in IDFX-format. The data is collected to be used for verifying the concepts and
models implemented in THEtool and for evaluating the performance of the software on real-life data.
