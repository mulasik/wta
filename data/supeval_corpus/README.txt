=== SUPEVAL CORPUS ===

Supeval corpus is a corpus of 10 texts written in three different languages (French, German, and English), belonging to different genres, produced by writers of varying ages, educational levels, and language competencies. The texts in French come from the Pro-TEXT corpus (Cislaru and Olive 2020), whereas the one in English and German were collected specifically for the evaluation of THEtool. The writing sessions were recorded with Inputlog (Leijten and Van Waes 2005) and ScriptLog (Johansson et al. 2018), and we used the IDFX files produced by these tools as input for THEtool.
